# SCFHP-Machine-learning-model
"""
In this amazing and cool project i created a dataset and imported the file by pandas, and visualized my findings.
The goal of this project was to take an already physical log in system and put it on a csv file from excel.

Along with the goal of the project i was able to form a learning objective of to see if from our location we could find any disparities or other themes and patterns in our companies outreach and the availabilty of the resource center. 

Along with the data science aspect i created a simple supervised machine learning prediction model to predict future attendance at our resource center by months and reason for attendance, all while using a train/test split method as well as some cross validation and random forest methods. My findings and code used will be displayed amoung this project repository.
